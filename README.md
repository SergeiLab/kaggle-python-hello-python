My First Python Code: Hello, Python
This repository contains my very first Jupyter Notebook, created as part of the Kaggle "Python" course. It serves as a foundational project for my journey into data science.

Project Description
This project is a simple introduction to fundamental Python concepts. The code demonstrates basic syntax, variable assignment, arithmetic operations, and string manipulation in a fun way, inspired by a Monty Python skit.

Motivation
As a beginner, this project was my first step into the world of Python and data science. My goal was to learn the essential building blocks of the language and understand how to use a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Data Source
This is a coding tutorial and does not use a specific dataset. The examples are provided directly within the Kaggle notebook.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used.

Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment for writing and running the code.

Key Findings
This exercise reinforced my understanding of several key Python concepts:

Variables: How to declare and reassign variables (e.g., spam_amount).

Comments: Using the # symbol to add notes to the code.

Operators: Simple arithmetic (+) and string multiplication (*).

Conditionals: Using if statements for logical branching.

How to Use
To explore the code and reproduce the results, you can follow these steps:

Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) in this repository.

Open it in a Jupyter environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab, or a local installation).

Run the cells sequentially to see the code's output.
